        p.card-text Strike is tough but we do it together.  We start strike at 10:00 am on Sunday (the day of the Temple burn). It is expected that you are in camp and participating with strike until it's complete.

        p.card-text We usually work until dark, then go to the Temple burn together as a camp. Work continues after the burn. Last year we finished late Monday and expect to finish at a similar time this year.

        p.card-text Please plan ahead accordingly; leave yourself some energy so that you're not completely destroyed on Sunday.
        p.card-text One of the core principles of our camp is that everyone participates in strike until all the work is done. We party together but we also clean up together. In years past strike has ended Monday night.
